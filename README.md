# Meeting: Impossible
Using an open-source face recognition library integrated with OpenCV, this Flask app aims to make exchanging contact information at meetings easier.

## Problem: A hypothetical scenario
Susie has to attend an international conference tonight for work. She wants to meet as many new faces as possible while creating real connections. She goes to the conference, gets to know a lot of great people, but by the end of the night, she finds that she forgot to ask for their contact information. The conversation was so amazing! She is very sad she might not be able to chat with them again.

## Solution
Before the conference, each attendee will add in their basic contact information, with a little description about themselves and upload a headshot of themselves. During the conference, if you feel that you've connected with someone, take a quick picture of them or with them (with consent, of course). After the conference, upload the picture onto the app to find out who you were talking to and how you can meet them again. :)

## Future Features
- Added security i.e. login with unique conference ids
